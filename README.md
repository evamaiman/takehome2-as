# Code and Design Decisions

<!-- Please document your code & design decisions here. -->

- The page can be viewed at /PropertyListings
- I wasn't sure what "Use style definitions from Figma when possible" meant. I wasn't able to get any CSS properties from the Figma mockup and just ended up eyeballing the styling (such as font size, spacing, padding, etc).
- Due to time constraints I didn't do the following:
- - Write complex unit tests (such as for local storage or toggling favorites). I only wrote a couple simple tests that verified that the basic functionality was working.
- - Accessibility. One issue is the unfilled heart does not show up well on some images when the background is white. One also can't use the keyboard to tab through the hearts or toggle them, it has to be done with the mouse/trackpad.
- - Localization
- - Mobile rendering. I tested the page rendered correctly on a computer by resizing my browser, but didn't have time to fix any defects on mobile interfaces.
